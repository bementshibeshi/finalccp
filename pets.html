                <div>
                    <p>Moxie was a black Labrador and Pitbull mix. She was very stylish (as you cna see in the images). She spent most of her days talking walks, silently watching squirrels through the window, or taking long naps when she wasn't eating. Although Moxie was not my dog, she was my bestfriend's dog and I was responsble for caring for her sometimes and built quite a close bond with her.<br> 
                    You may have noticed I used past tense when refering to Moxie in the previous text, that is because this past summer of 2023 Moxie sadly passed away due to fluid build up in her chest. Fair to say I cried like a baby at the vets and the doctor was a bit sonfused as to why a friend of the grieving family was crying more than them. :( </P>
